/* In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=). */
/* If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, 
those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable 
on the left of the operator */
//Assign the value 7 to variable a.
// Setup
var a;
