/* In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. 
This means that capitalization matters.
MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar.  

Best Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase.*/
// Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = 'A String';
titleCaseOver = 9000;
